This repo contains few basic socket programs, which I wrote during laboratory sessions in my Masters. It contains :
- A simple TCP client and server chat program
- A simple UDP client and server chat program
- A simple file sync tool between two remote machines
- A naive implementation for Lamport's Algorithm for Distributed Mutual Exclusion
- A naive implementation for Lamport's Logical Clock using 3 processes
